During the year the group revamped its Strategy 2025 – “Accelerating Green Growth” in the face of a challenging operating environment, punctuated by a slowdown of cement market demand, high energy cost and increased raw material costs. The Group Turnover at KES 39.2 billion was 5% below prior year. This was driven by volume decline in both Kenya and Uganda. The decline in sales volumes and turnover is primarily due to a decrease in government infrastructure projects spend, suppressed consumer purchasing power, and stunted private sector credit growth, which was exacerbated by market contraction experienced from the month of May due to Kenya’s general elections. Bamburi Group registered drop of operating profit by 22% on a like-for-like basis (LFL) compared to prior year. This is primarily attributable to decline in topline coupled with significant inflation of the fuel prices, logistics costs and imported clinker prices in both Kenya and Uganda. The Group is however confident that it will register improved performance and profitability in the future driven by the revamped business strategy, expected recovery of the economy. “To sustain our market leadership growth momentum, the Group revamped its “Strategy 2025 – Accelerating Green Growth” to become the market leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions” Economic Environment in our main East African Markets Kenya’s Economic recovery remains strong, although it was slowed by drought and inflation. The rising cost of commodities globally continues to impose inflationary pressure on already stretched consumer disposable income. The steep increases in the headline inflation (+5.7 % in December 2021, and +9.1 % in December 2022), coupled with the rising cost of inputs, is placing further pressure on consumer purchasing power impacting cement demand and cement production costs. The global conflicts in Eastern Europe impacted prices of imported raw material and freight intensifying inflation pressures during the year. The economic recovery was also dampened by global commodity price shocks, the long regional drought, and uncertainty in the run up to the 2022 general elections. Uganda’s near-term macroeconomic outlook, foresees sustained recovery driving real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth to 5.5% during fiscal year 2022/23 from 4.7% in fiscal year 2021/22. The outlook remains broadly positive, hinged on continued implementation of the government’s National Development Plan (NDP III) and full recovery of global trade. The inflation of our other main East African markets (Rwanda, DRC and South Sudan) continues to increase. This was largely driven by international commodity prices and the disruption of global supply chain leading to substantial increase in energy, transport, and food prices. Overall, East African markets have some of the lowest cement consumption per capita, implying greater upside potential for sustainable growth driven by increasing GDP growth and infrastructure development. Energy and Power prices Energy and power costs are the biggest cost components in the production and distribution of our products. In 2022, both our Kenya and Uganda operations were affected by external costs. The steady rise in oil prices was mainly driven by global supply chain challenges, geopolitical and trade tensions among the key players. This has led to inflation of prices of imported raw materials and energy costs especially on coal thus eroding the margins. High power tariffs in Kenya adversely impacted our full performance. Fuel subsidy abolishment in August 2022 resulted in increase in the cost of electricity by about 15%. This put more pressure on the pricing across the economy as producers of services and goods had to factor in the higher cost of energy. To address the challenge of increasing electric power cost, the Company is evaluating alternative power sources. This will reduce costs, improve our profitability as well as contribute to Net Zero carbon emissions by switching to renewable energy. Cement Market Although, the Kenya Cement market witnessed growth at the beginning of the year, this optimism was dampened by disruptions to international supply chains because of COVID-19 pandemic and the Eastern Europe conflict. The Country’s general elections further impacted the market alongside prevailing inflation rates and slowdown in consumer credit growth. The supply challenges experienced in the first half of the year led to a general rise in cement prices. The market has experienced excess availability of cement in the second half of the year leading to aggressive competition and pressure on cement selling prices in a bid to clear excess inventory within the context of a contracting market. Ugandan cement market registered a 6% growth compared to prior year mainly driven by urbanization as well as the start of construction works in the oil and gas projects. Bamburi Cement Group is optimistic about the growth of the cement sector within EAC and continues to reassert its presence in the market through innovation and launch of new products and high quality construction solutions to all segments. Sustainability The Group is committed to promoting sustainability. In line with this commitment, it launched a series of green products designed to lower CO2 and NOX emissions. The launch of these green construction solutions showcases the company’s commitment to sustainable construction. Its core brands, including BAMBURI NGUVU, BAMBURI TEMBO, BAMBURI FUNDI, and BAMBURI DURACEM, have been acknowledged for their positive impact on sustainability efforts. Dr. John Simba Chairman FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022 Energy and power costs are the biggest cost components in the production and distribution of our products. In 2022, both our Kenya and Uganda operations were affected by external costs. The steady rise in oil prices was mainly driven by global supply chain challenges, geopolitical and trade tensions among the key players. This has led to inflation of prices of imported raw materials and energy costs especially on coal thus eroding the margins. BAMBURI CEMENT | ANNUAL REPORT 17 16 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 2023 Outlook The economic recovery in Kenya and Uganda is expected to continue. As global value chains stabilize and consumer demand rises, manufacturing growth is projected to accelerate. Kenya’s economy is expected to record moderate growth over the coming years, driven by a dynamic services sector and favorable demographics. Growth over the last few years has been driven by private consumption, in particular the expansion of the services sector, which is among Sub-Saharan Africa’s most innovative. In Uganda, the GDP growth is expected to be fuelled by greater investment in public infrastructure especially in oil industry. To exploit available opportunities, the company will continue to support construction of affordable housing, new technologies (3D printing) and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Group will continue to drive robust cost management initiatives to drive profitability. The East Africa cement markets are projected to remain highly competitive. To sustain our market leadership growth momentum, the Group revamped its “Strategy 2025 – Accelerating Green Growth” to become the market leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions. The strategy is anchored on four value drivers: accelerating growth; expanding solutions and products; leading in sustainability and innovation; and delivering superior performance. Through “Accelerating Green Growth,” Bamburi Group will achieve profitable growth across all its businesses, fuelled by sustainability and innovation. With this strategic framework in place we are well positioned to seize and serve opportunities ahead as we become the market leader in innovative and sustainable building. Appreciation I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Board of Directors, Group Managing Director, Leadership Team, Employees, Customers, Partners, Shareholders, and all other Stakeholders for their invaluable contribution to our resilient performance in 2022. The Board has the confidence that the Group has the leadership and the people to exploit opportunities presented to us to the best advantage for our shareholders and all stakeholders. I am optimistic that we will continue to see further acceleration of our momentum under the direction of our new and dynamic Group Managing Director Mr. Mohit Kapoor, who brings a wealth of experience in corporate leadership and driving consistent business growth. I extend the best wishes to the immediate former Group Managing Director Mr. Seddiq Hassani in his next chapter of leadership and commend him for his immeasurable value in the organisation. The Board will continue to provide management with the necessary oversight and support as they execute on their strategic priorities. Dr. John Simba Chairman 27 April 2023 Oryxes at the Bamburi Haller Park BAMBURI CEMENT | ANNUAL REPORT 19 18 GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT “Drive performance in the face of a challenging operating environment” Mohit Kapoor Group Managing Director Operating Environment During the year under review, the company continued to drive its strategy to drive profitability. However, the year was quite challenging as the country continued to grapple with steep increases in the headline inflation, high fuel and power prices which significantly impacted negatively our business performance during the year. Across East Africa region, the global conflicts in Eastern Europe impacted prices of imported raw material and freight intensifying inflation pressures during the year. The economic recoveries were also dampened by global commodity price shocks, the long regional drought, and uncertainty in the run up to the Kenya 2022 general elections. The local currencies continued to depreciate affecting the cost of imported raw materials pushing up the production costs. Digital Strategy Digitalization of our business is the way forward. In 2022, we created sustained value for our stakeholders through an adaptable and resilient IT business model, accelerating our digital transformation journey to deliver enhanced value to the business and our customers. Digitization of our business processes continued to take center stage of our operations. We also embarked on an organization-wide digitization of our existing archives and automation of business processes to eliminate the use of paper under a project dubbed EcoSafi. In Uganda, Hima cement kicked off various plant automation projects to introduce new levels of efficiency, and sustainability of operations. In financial year 2022, Hima Cement also rolled out and implemented the e-permit to work system as part of our digital initiative to Drive Safety Compliance. This initiative has reduced the amount of paper work involved in execution of tasks and increased visibility of the team’s understanding of risks while at work, because the permits can be viewed remotely hence enhancing leadership and compliance to the safety standards. In addition, the business also rolled out an HSE app which is managing the online HSE equipment and tools inspection, training calendar, reward and consequence management, mobile equipment inspection and logistics truck inspection. Product Innovation The Group continues to champion innovation in construction industry. During the year under review, the company developed another construction solution to resolve challenges in the tiling sector and tap into the growing demand for specialty mortar products such as tile adhesives. The company launched a ready-to-use tile adhesive by the brand name ‘Bamburi TectorCeram SETI 300’. Designed for placement of porous tiles including ceramic, terracotta, earthenware and natural stone tiles, Bamburi SETI 300 is a cementitious mortar product produced from carefully sourced raw materials, including chemical admixtures, Bamburi cement and sand. In Uganda, the group continued to reposition the business for growth and innovation while adapting to our customer needs. We also launched the dry mortar range of products (Tector Ceram) which aims to help our customers with mix ratios for better structures. The new complementary range of products offers value for the customers; ensuring superior internal and external building finishing design, unveiling the beauty in every construction project. They are tried and tested to produce a quality result, providing enhanced bonding attributes, great workability and are ready-to-use by adding the recommended amount of water. Sustainability Sustainability is at the core of our strategy. We are leading in the circular economy by reducing waste and recycling materials across our business. We are innovating to remain at the forefront of green building solutions and driving circular construction to build better with less. In 2022, we made tremendous strides towards further integrating sustainability in our business operations. We launched our Sustainability report referenced by the Global Reporting Index (GRI) and shared our vision and progress towards building for people and the planet. Highlighting our key sustainability milestones across our five strategic pillars and guided by our Materiality Assessment which sought the input of both internal and external stakeholders. We also constituted our first Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee consisting of 12 pillar expert leaders who diligently support our sustainability reporting and the development and implementation of the company’s ESG strategies. Additionally, we launched the Holcim Eco-Label for cement on the packaging of our greener cements which are Bamburi Fundi, Bamburi Tembo56, Bamburi Nguvu and Bamburi Duracem. The eco-label is a testimony of sustainable cement products with more than 30% reduction of CO2 emissions. The ECO-label helps our customers identify at first sight the environmental impact of their purchasing choice, allowing them to make the choice to build better. Health and Safety The Group aspires to conduct its business with zero harm to people while providing a safe and healthy working environment. Strict HSE policies guide our decision-making to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our employees, their families, and all our suppliers and stakeholders. We consider this a moral imperative and that is why we put health, safety and protecting the physical environment at the heart of everything we do. During the year, Nairobi Grinding Plant received an HSE Excellence Award from the Group for its outstanding Health, Safety and Environment performance in 2021, being one of the only four units in the MEA region to receive this recognition. HSE Excellence Awards are given to Units and Countries which demonstrate high performance in critical risk management, continuous improvement and engagement. Overall, Kenya scored 91.7% on the 2022 Country HSE Continuous Improvement Score. Under leading indicators the country achieved 100% in Critical Risk Reduction having closed all findings due in 2022 from Process Safety Audits and Group Health & Safety Management System Audits. Under lagging indicators there were no fatalities or Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) reported from our sites. The critical risk management program launched in 2021 was a key focus area during the year. A Group Core Assessment Audit covering eight priority unwanted BAMBURI CEMENT | ANNUAL REPORT 21 20 GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT events (PUEs) was conducted in Q1 2022 and was instrumental in streamlining and accelerating the implementation of this program and as a result the compliance score on critical controls at the end of the year was at 86%. Additionally during the year, four additional PUEs were added to the program: fatal road crash, respiratory illness, emergency response and water pollution discharge. This will continue to be a key focus area in 2023 to ensure 100% compliance across all the critical control areas. The performance on worker engagement in 2022 was exemplary with all key indicators scoring above the target. The momentum achieved on our Boots on Ground (BoG) program in 2021 was sustained all through the year. BoG is a worker engagement initiative supported by a digital platform where managers undertake shopfloor tours and engage workers in conversations on HSE topics involving their work. The program has produced great results, playing a big role in proactive identification of any gaps and their timely closure before they resulted in incidents. In Uganda, we conducted robust comprehensive audits and reviews of existing processes and put in place solid, sustainable systems to guard against the most critical risks and mitigate future incidences. During the year, Hima Cement embraced the BoG program and applied it in identifying hazards and performing Visible Personal Commitments (VPCs). BoG supports our safety interventions by registering the time spent in the field by our managers and supervisors, being visible and present leaders. All employees are provided with smart phones to promote the participation in identifying and reporting hazards while out on the shop floor. All hazards identified are captured on the online portal, assigned to the responsible individual with clear deadlines for remediation and closure. Performance On performance, the group’s turnover for the year ended 31 December 2022 declined by 5% to KES 39.2 billion in comparison with year 2021. The turnover performance was driven by reduced volumes primarily due to a decrease in government infrastructure spend, suppressed consumer purchasing power which was exacerbated by market contraction experienced during the second half of the year due to Kenya’s general elections. Similarly, the operating profit before tax, for year ended 31 December 2022 declined by 33% to KShs 1.1 billion compared to the year ended 31 December 2021. This was driven by reduced volumes coupled with significant inflation of the energy prices, logistics costs in both Kenya and Uganda affected the operating profit. The Group profitability was also negatively impacted by depreciation of the Kenya shilling and Uganda shilling against other major currencies pushing up the production costs. Future Outlook We continue to implement our Strategy 2025 – “Accelerating Green Growth” to grow our profitability by embedding customer-centricity across the business and offering innovative building solutions. With “Accelerating Green Growth,” Bamburi Group will achieve profitable growth across all its businesses, fueled by sustainability and innovation. The uncertain environment due to headwinds such as drought, high inflation, global shocks and public debt coupled with potential macroeconomic disruptions remain a source of pressure on consumer purchasing power impacting cement demand. However, we remain vigilant and proactive to counter any headwinds while at the same time continuing to support our customers and partners. For the year ahead, the Group remains committed to ensuring that the business stays responsive to the needs of the communities in which we operate in, not only for business reasons but for the environmental and social purposes to achieve a sustainable business. The Group remains a true partner with regional governments in major development projects. We will continue to support the government’s focus on affordable housing through new technologies like 3D printing and key infrastructure projects. In Uganda we will also continue to focus on supplying key strategic projects including the Oil sector and new markets in East Africa. Appreciation In conclusion, and most importantly, on behalf of the Board I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all our shareholders, customers, community stakeholders, national government, county governments as well as partners for their continued and unwavering support accorded towards creating more value for all stakeholders. Special mention to our Board of Directors for their support, guidance, and wise counsel which has made it possible to rebound and revamp our business strategy. I would also wish to recognize and celebrate our Management and employees for their continued agility and resilience throughout these difficult times. They have demonstrated deep commitment to the business, agility in a time of uncertainty, and the creativity and innovation that has enabled the business to adapt and take lessons from the experiences of the pandemic. We have no doubt that we will emerge stronger and with confidence to look forward to a better future. Finally, I wish to commend the immediate former Group Managing Director Seddiq Hassani for the milestones achieved in the last 5 years as well as a smooth transition. Thank you.

The statement covers Bamburi Cement (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’) Overview Bamburi Group has delivered a strong performance in a challenging operating environment. The Group’s full-year financial results demonstrate the great resilience of our business. The significant growth in volume, our product innovation, the improved price performance along with the continued benefit from “HEALTH, COST & CASH” management action plan, which adopted at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, were the key drivers of 2021 performance. Net sales of Kes 41.4 bn for the full year 2021 were up 19% on a like-for-like basis (LFL) compared to prior year. This significant increase was driven by volume growth in both Kenya and Uganda on account of strong performance in retail and key accounts segments. This also reflects the continued economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic impact. Group’s overall average selling price improved compared to prior year on account of Kenya’s higher proportion of premium products sales and targeted price actions in the retail segment. On the contrary, in Uganda the average selling price was negatively affected by the product mix and decrease of exported volumes. Bamburi Group registered an impressive 22% year on year profit before tax growth despite the significant cost inflation on energy and imported clinker. Cash flow generated from operations at Kes 4.5 bn was lower compared to prior year by 35% reflecting the additional investment in working capital on account of a higher level of business operations in the current year. The Group’s liquidity and balance sheet remains strong and is a sure foundation for future growth. In fiscal year 2021, Bamburi Group weathered through storm by rapid execution of our “HEALTH, COST & CASH” action plan, effectively driving cost savings, while managing to deliver healthy free cash flow. Through agile and effective crisis management, the company’s action plan launched in March 2020, has successfully safeguarded the health and safety of its people, partners and communities, while mitigating the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Economic Environment in East African markets The Kenyan economy continued with recovery in 2021, with GDP growth estimated at 5.6%. This growth was supported by a stable macroeconomic and political environment, continued governmental spending in infrastructure projects and recovery in the service sector following the ease of Covid-19 pandemic as a result of the mass vaccination campaigns. The implementation of the Big 4 agenda, where affordable housing is one of the key pillars, continues to provide much needed reassurance on government focus on infrastructure spending and housing where there still exists a huge gap for growth. 2021 Uganda’s economic growth was estimated at 4.7% driven by increased infrastructure investment, foreign direct investment in the oil and mining subsectors, and a conducive business environment. These factors are expected to continue driving economic growth in future over the short and medium term. Rwandan economic growth remains robust and estimated at 5.1% in 2021. The growth in Rwanda was supported by increased exports (“Made in Rwanda” campaign), continued investments in public sector infrastructure like airport, and the country’s strong record of implementing reforms to achieve its long-term development goals. Overall, both Kenya and Uganda have some of the lowest cement consumption per capita, implying greater upside potential for sustainable growth driven by increasing GDP growth and infrastructure development. Global Supply Chain, Raw Materials, Energy and Power prices Energy prices in 2021 remained volatile due to steady rise in oil prices, global uncertainties mainly driven by continuing global supply chain challenges and geopolitical and trade tensions amongst the key players. Global supply chain has also been disrupted by the pandemic and compounded by FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW BUSINESS OVERVIEW 22 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 23 PART OF YOU FROM THE START PART OF YOU FROM THE START 2021 OVERVIEW CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT in, and which has resulted in another successful year. You have re-positioned the Group strategically for Growth. The Spirit of resilience that you have demonstrated, in the face of challenges, and which is the spirit behind our “Strategy 2025 - Accelerating Green Growth” has been rewarded as we register sound growth in both top line and profitability for the Group in the year 2021. I am confident that we will continue to see further acceleration of our momentum. The Board has the confidence that the Group has the leadership and the people to exploit the opportunities presented to us, to the best advantage of our shareholders and all stakeholders. Dr. John Simba Chairman 26 April 2022 the Suez Canal incident that has had long term effect on shipping costs. This has led to inflation of prices of imported raw materials and energy costs especially on our coal and clinker imports thus eroding the margins. Higher power tariffs adversely impacted our performance though a downward review plan in Kenya was implemented by the government effective January 2022. The power prices remained high in Kenya. Going forward, to address the challenge of increasing electric power cost, the group has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with an Independent Power Producer, to set up two Solar Plants adjacent to the company’s Mombasa Plant and Nairobi Grinding Plant. The project which aims to save on power costs as well as contribute to Net Zero carbon emissions by switching to renewable energy, is set to deploy solar power systems with a total capacity of 14.5MW and 5MW for Bamburi’s Mombasa Plant and Nairobi Grinding Plant respectively. This will account for up to approximately 40% of Bamburi’s total power supply. The group is switching to more affordable and clean energy that will not only lead to a significant reduction in power costs but also bring us closer to our goal of achieving Net Zero carbon emissions. The construction of the solar power plants is scheduled to begin end of 2022, after requisite regulatory approvals with expected completion within a year. Market Highlights for the Financial Year Kenya and Uganda cement markets recorded positive performance over the period. In Kenya, the cement market growth was largely attributed to infrastructure investments during the year and recovery in construction activities in the individual house builders segment. We have witnessed significant activity in government funded infrastructure projects. Going forward, we expect in the coming year a moderate growth in anticipation of the presidential elections. We believe that the elections will not significantly affect cement uptake and the market will recover eventually slightly above 2021 levels. In Uganda cement market also grew in 2021, against a background of stable interest rates in the economy and recovery in the construction industry. The market continues to grow as cement becomes more affordable due to increased supply. Both the cement markets in Kenya and Uganda have excess cement grinding capacity putting pressure on cement prices. 2022 Outlook In East Africa, we envisage growth in cement demand supported by a stable economic environment. In Kenya, the big four government agenda in the areas of recognisable sustainable housing projects and significant investments in infrastructure projects in the pipeline is expected to fuel the growth of the cement market. The Eastern European conflict is expected to have an adverse impact on the global economy and especially on freight and imported raw material prices. In addition, the impact of the coming general election is an unquantified risk factor which potentially might affect market dynamics. In Uganda, cement demand is expected to be fuelled by greater investment in public infrastructure especially in the oil industry. Overall, the East Africa markets are projected to remain highly competitive. To sustain our market leadership growth momentum, the Group will execute its Strategy 2025 – “Accelerating Green Growth” to become the market leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions. With “Accelerating Green Growth,” Bamburi Group will achieve profitable growth across all its businesses, fuelled by sustainability and innovation. It will accelerate the expansion of its Solutions & Products business, positioning itself in the most attractive segments of the construction value chain with new technologies. With our strategy ‘Accelerating Green Growth’ we are ready to seize the opportunities ahead, on our way to become the market leader in innovative and sustainable building. Bamburi’s “Strategy 2025 - Accelerating Green Growth” has four value drivers: accelerating growth, expanding solutions & products, leading in sustainability and innovation and delivering superior performance. Appreciation I wish to thank the management and staff of Bamburi Group for the hard work that you have put 24 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 25 PART OF YOU FROM THE START PART OF YOU FROM THE START FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW BUSINESS OVERVIEW MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT 2021 OVERVIEW Overview 2021 was our first full year operating in an unprecedented global pandemic but we have demonstrated remarkable organizational resilience and character to emerge stronger. The group achieved a record topline and profitability growth thanks to Bamburi family for their exceptional resilience as they continue to successfully navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic in a dynamic business environment. On the back of this solid performance, the group kept its focus on its key long-term value creation drivers to become the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions. The Group recorded significant growth in sales volumes and turnover driven by accelerated government infrastructure projects and good growth momentum for retail and export markets. We have continued playing a major role in supplying construction solutions for key projects in various sectors like rail, power, roads, ports and water as the East Africa community continues to offer attractive investment opportunities. Going forward, in 2022, Kenya’s domestic cement demand is expected to remain flat over prior year while the exports are expected to grow thanks to the opening up of opportunities in the greater eastern Africa market including Rwanda, Burundi, DRC and Zanzibar. In Uganda, Cement demand for 2022 is projected to increase as major Oil and Gas projects are expected to commence after agreements were signed between Total E&P, CNOOC and the Government of Uganda. In Uganda, the group continued to reposition the business for growth and innovation while adopting to our customer needs by launching a new Masonry cement “FUNDI 22.5X” in February 2021 for Central, East and northern markets as well as in July for the Western and Export Markets. Hima cement also reformulated Minecem making it the greenest cement in the region with 89% CO2 reduction. Digitalization of our business is the way forward. During the year, we created sustained value for our stakeholders through an adaptable and resilient IT business model, accelerating our digital transformation journey to deliver enhanced value to the business and our customers. For instance, Kenya implemented FIRE-Q and ROOTs, cloud based quality and customer ordering, scheduling and dispatching systems for Ready Mix business. In Uganda, Hima launched the Kafluu Chatbot that allows customers to buy cement countrywide using the WhatsApp social platform. In 2021, the group finalized a feasibility study for a 5000tpd state-of-the-art Greenfield project for the construction of an integrated cement plant. Facing strong and resilient demand growth with a positive outlook for the long term future, Bamburi Cement is pursuing its clinker capacity development options located in the South East of Kenya, along the coast in Matuga. The feasibility study has carefully considered environmental, business and market studies as well as various technical and design concepts to ensure that the new clinker line will be efficient, sustainable and will positively contribute to Kenya’s and Matuga’s development. The Group will continue to execute Strategy 2025 – “Accelerating Green Growth” with the drive to grow and sustain its market leadership position. Going forward, the group will continue to leverage on the direct sales channel, product innovation, robust cost management and value added products in ready mix and precast formats, supported by a mobile laboratory. The group is well positioned to capture and create new growth opportunities going forward.

Post covid market recovery, the cement demand is expected to be impacted by national elections in August 2022. The group will remain a true partner with regional governments in major development projects. We will continue to support the Big 4 Agenda in Kenya specifically the construction of affordable housing, we also support new technologies (3D printing) and key infrastructure projects such as dams, the expressway, bypasses and road interchanges. In Uganda we will also continue to focus on supplying key strategic projects including the Oil sector and new markets in Tanzania as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo Mining industry with a 5 year contract worth 500 kt of cement signed with Barrick Gold. Overall, the Group is optimistic as it maximizes topline opportunities and continues to drive robust cost management initiatives to optimize its cost base. The group is well positioned for growth to create value for all our stakeholders in the medium to long term. The Group’s priority continues to be the implementation of necessary measures to enhance business resilience and to protect the health and safety of our employees and their families during the Covid-19 pandemic. Appreciation I would like to recognize and celebrate loyal customers, suppliers, community stakeholders, as well as national and county governments, for the support they continue to accord to us. We continue to count on your support as we embark on our Accelerating Green Growth strategy and give our commitment to you of generating and sharing greater value with you all. I would also wish to recognize and celebrate our Management and employees for their continued agility and resilience throughout these difficult times. They have demonstrated deep commitment to the business, agility in a time of uncertainty, and the creativity and innovation that has enabled the business to adapt and take lessons from the experiences of the pandemic. We have no doubt that we will emerge stronger and with confidence to look forward to a better future. Seddiq Hassani Managing Director 26 April 2022 Health and Safety Health and Safety is the Group’s overarching value in its operations. In Kenya, 2021 was a good year with great improvement compared to 2020. In the leading indicators, Kenya achieved 100% closure of the strategic Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Improvement Plan; Process Management Actions (PSM) were closed at 100%, as well as 100% closure of Health, Safety Management Systems (HSMS) audit actions. However, in the lagging indicators registered two Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) (one in Mombasa Plant (MOM) and one in Nairobi Grinding Plant (NAI), one Modified Work Duty in NAI, and two Medical Injuries in MOM. In Uganda, Hima Cement recorded a good HSE performance, registering no LTI, which set the best record in the last five years, of 749 days without an LTI. All HSE improvement plans were fully achieved at 100% closure rate. In 2021, Bamburi Group also launched an exciting program called Boots on the Ground (BoG), supported by a digital platform, where managers and supervisors spend time with workers in their operational areas, to have conversations around health and safety and monitor appropriate implementation of our HSE policies. The program has produced great results, playing a big role in proactive identification of any gaps and their timely closure before they resulted in incidents. Operational and Financial Performance The Group Turnover at Kes 41.4bn was 19% above 2020 at Kes 34.9bn. In Kenya, turnover grew by 20% driven by recovery in the retail sector after Covid-19 restrictions in 2020, higher volume sold to government funded infrastructure projects in the year and growing export sales to new markets in the region. In Uganda, the turnover grew by 17% on account of increased volume to the local and exports markets despite the Covid-19 pandemic impact. The overall average selling prices for the group were better than prior year. Kenya recorded better average selling price thanks to a higher proportion of sales of premium products compared to prior year and price action in the retail segment. However, in Uganda, the average selling price was negatively impacted by product mix composed of lower infrastructure projects which consumes high end products and exports. The Group Operating Profit grew to Kes 2,315m in 2021 representing a 17% growth driven by growth in turnover, robust cost management through various cost initiatives and operational efficiencies. This solid performance was achieved despite increase in coal prices, power prices, imported clinker and global fuel prices which continued to adversely affect our cost base. Profit before income tax at Kes 2,172m (2020: Kes 1,776m) was up by 22%. On top of the better operating performance, we saw a decrease of the net cost of finance by Kes 64m or 31% from Kes 207m in 2020 to Kes 143m in 2021. Total Comprehensive income for the year grew by 19% from Kes 1,919m in 2020 to Kes 2,291m in 2021 driven by higher profit for the year and a registered exchange gain in retranslation of Uganda shillings into Kenya Shillings at Kes 942m (2020: Kes 807m). Cash flow The cash flow generated from operations declined by 35% from Kes 6,787m in 2020 to Kes 4,390m in 2021 driven by growth in receivables and inventories. This reflects additional investment in working capital required due to a higher level of business operations in the current year compared to prior year in addition to the strong material and energy price increases towards the end of 2021. The Group’s liquidity and balance sheet remains strong and is a sure foundation for future growth. Going forward, the group will continue to preserve cash through optimization of its working capital requirements. This will involve rigorous credit management on trade receivables, optimal inventories holding levels through coshipment initiatives and extension of supplier payment terms through various trade finance instruments and extend supplier payment days over the budget period. 2022 Outlook The group is cautiously optimistic that the headwinds MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT 2021 OVERVIEW 28 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 PART OF YOU FROM THE START BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 29 PART OF YOU FROM THE START FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW BUSINESS OVERVIEW 2021 OVERVIEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS DR.

The impact of the pandemic was unprecedented, and was to be felt both from a public health perspective, as well as from a socio-economic level. Like every other community and business in the world, we had to brace ourselves for the worst, take our position to confront the situation headon, while hoping for the best. The Covid-19 crisis presented the biggest challenge our markets have had to deal with in recent times. Like everywhere else in the world, our people, our business and our communities have faced a difcult period. In the year 2020, the Kenyan economy was impacted adversely, a little more than the Ugandan economy, given its signifcant exposure to Tourism, a sector which was a lot more impacted adversely. As we navigated through the pandemic, our number one priority was to keep our people and communities safe. We took deliberate measures to preserve the health of our people as we worked to protect the business. Chairman’s Statement “Resilient business performance in a challenging environment of a global Covid-19 pandemic.” Dr. John Simba Chairman Our Response to the Covid-19 Crisis: The HEALTH, COST & CASH Initiative In March 2020, the Group launched the “HEALTH, COST & CASH” (HCC) initiative whose objective was to safeguard the health and safety of our people, partners and communities, while mitigating the anticipated adverse fnancial impact of the pandemic on the business. The HCC initiative was executed fawlessly, with agility and precision. Health Working quickly to respond to the evolving crisis, The Bamburi Group amplifed its focus on health with the intention to preserve the health of our employees, our customers and of the communities in which we operate. The Group quickly put together a Covid-19 Business Resilience Team (BRT) made up of the executive committee and senior managers in the business. The BRT was tasked with the responsibility of closely monitoring the unfolding events, proactively formulating appropriate business response policies, and executing the same in a swift and timely manner. Through the BRT, a wide range of measures to protect our teams and contain the spread of Covid-19 within our community were executed. This included the creation of critical response documentation for specifc operational focus points, reducing the number of people on our operating sites at any one point in time, introducing alternative work arrangements in compliance with mandated public health protocols, introduction and facilitation of remote working, screening of every individual on site, enforcing necessary hygiene and sanitisation measures on operating sites, and deploying emergency response measures in the face of infection threats. We furnished our employees with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and consumables for use by themselves and their families. Care packs containing appropriate masks, gloves, sanitisers and thermometers were given out to our employees and the consumables in them replenished as and when the need arose. Similar care packs were extended to our customers including transporters, as well as to the communities that we work with. As a responsible corporate citizen, the Group also supported various government sponsored Covid-19 containment initiatives through cash and PPE donations. Cost Saving: Given the expected adverse impact on the cement market on account of the Covid-19 containment measures such as lockdowns, curfews and the need to limit personal contact with customers, the Group’s response was to mitigate the adverse impact of revenue shrinkage on the bottomline by saving on costs. The Group restricted or avoided altogether, non-critical spends, and focused only on those budget heads that were critical. As a result of the cost saving measures, Year 2020 Group Proft before Tax closed at Kes 1,776m (Kes 728m in 2019), a 144% increase over 2019. This is a demonstration of great resilience of our business in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. Cash Preservation: To preserve cash, the Group amongst other initiatives, implemented the following: • Suspension or re-prioritisation of certain capital projects • Optimisation of inventory levels • Minimisation of exposure to trade receivables by reviewing of our credit policy and launching an aggressive collection drive. As a consequence of the Cash Preservation measures, the Group generated a record cash fow from operations of Kes 6,860m (2019: Kes 3,659m), a 87% increase over the previous year. Cement Market & Competition Kenya and Uganda cement market recorded mixed performance over the period. In Kenya, the cement market size contracted in the frst half borne by the slow down on construction activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the second half of the year recovered with volumes in 2020 outperforming prior year’s on a like for like basis. In the frst half of 2020, there was a gradual decline in activity in the building and construction sector driven by site closures especially in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kilif in response to reduced hours of working and lockdowns. In addition, liquidity challenges alongside competitive pressure occasioned by over-capacity situation in the Kenyan cement market, continued to put pressure on cement selling prices. However, in the second half of the year, the market recovered back to pre-Covid levels, driven by Individual Home Builders (IHB) segment and key infrastructure projects the Government had initiated. The Uganda cement market saw almost the same pattern as in Kenya with a strong second half of the year. Despite the market growth, the cement demand and supply was still afected by the adverse efects of the Covid-19 containment measures which came into force from late March 2020. With regards to export from Uganda to the adjacent regional markets, the volumes exported declined. The decline was attributable to plant supply constraints and logistics challenges caused by truck clearance delays at border points. Truck drivers were subjected to long queues and waiting times at the respective border points, the time during which they were subjected to Covid-19 testing and clearance protocols. BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 2020 OVERVIEW BUSINESS OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REVIEW 20 21 Setting Industry Standards in Health & Safety The strong fnancial performance delivered in the year 2020 is a foundation that we will build on to project forward into 2021. Appreciation On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank our customers, consumers, business partners as well as the governments of Kenya and Uganda where we operate, for their continued support. I also wish to thank our management and employees for their continued agility and resilience through the crisis. They have demonstrated deep commitment to this business, and I have no doubt that, with their continued eforts, we will emerge even stronger. I would also like to sincerely thank my fellow Bamburi Board members for their counsel, support and dedication throughout the year and for delivering a strong Corporate Governance environment. Together, we have made a strong positive mark on the business against the odds. We can do it again in the future. Dividends In consideration of the strong performance delivered in both bottom-line and Cash generation in the year 2020, and in recognition that the year 2020 was a difcult one fnancially for many, our esteemed shareholders included, the board of Bamburi Cement Limited, recommends the payment of a fnal dividend of Kes 3.00 per share. This is based on the Bamburi Cement Ltd parent company independent performance. The dividend will be paid on or about 15th July 2021 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 16th May 2021, subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 10th June 2021. Dr. John Simba, EGH, MBS, OGW. Chairman 20 April 2021 The Rwanda-Uganda border closure continued to afect trade relations and cement export between the two countries. However, as we look forward to the border reopening, we have continued to maintain presence in the Rwanda market through supplies ex Bamburi Cement Limited in Kenya. Through our Ugandan subsidiary (Hima Cement Limited), we are driving increased dispatches to East DRC as well as plugging up market supply gaps occasioned by the Rwanda situation. Performance Overview Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya and Uganda, the Group Turnover at Kes 34,884m in 2020 (2019:Kes 36,796m) declined by 5%. The decline occurred in the frst half of the year when impact of the Covid-19 containment measures on our volumes was most severe. In the frst half of 2020 the Group registered a revenue decline of 13%, while the second half registered positive growth Chairman’s Statement continued over prior year. Lower than prior year selling prices have also been experienced partly due to change in product mix. In Kenya, in February 2020, we launched “Fundi”, a 22.5 masonry cement which specifcally targets masonry, brick laying and plastering applications. The introduction of Fundi at a more afordable price into our range of product oferings has contributed to a lower than prior year average selling price. Competitive pressure has also contributed to pure price erosion. Despite decline in revenue, the operating Proft in 2020 at Kes 1,983m (2019: Kes 1,117m) grew signifcantly by 77.5%. This is testimony that the swift implementation of the “HEALTH, COST & CASH” action plan adopted by the Group at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has helped mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis. The hard work the business has invested in transforming itself through cost base optimization and process efciency; is making a big positive diference in the performance of the business. Our Resilience Total comprehensive proft after tax for the year at Kes 1,919m (2019: Kes 350m), which is a growth of 448%, achieved against a 5% decline in turnover, is testimony that our HCC strategy delivered as intended in response to a ravaging pandemic. The Group’s results for the year 2020, demonstrates the great resilience of our business. We are proud of our team’s agility to weather the storm, efectively driving cost savings ahead of revenue decline, improving net working capital and delivering a record high Cash Flow of Kes 4,857m (2019: Kes 359m). 2021 Outlook 2021 has started with both the Kenya and Uganda governments gradually easing the Covid-19 containment measures. However, both countries have continued to register new infection rates, albeit at reduced levels. At the time of writing this report, Kenya is experiencing a third wave which is believed to be of a new strain that is presenting more aggressively than the previous, as is evidenced by the higher rates of infections and mortality. In response, the Kenya government has reintroduced selective containment measures. In the wake of the third wave, not just in Kenya, but in many parts of the world, the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global and domestic supply chain is expected to persist through the remaining part of 2021. The strength of the economic recovery will depend in part on how Kenya and Uganda will be successful in accelerating vaccination, containing the new wave, fattening the curve, and subsequently easing of on the reintroduced containment measures. Despite the uncertainty in this space, as a Group, we will remain steadfast in delivering on our strategy. This in a bid to grow shareholders’ value as we advance our purpose of transforming lives. Our key focus remains to protect our people and partners, without whom we will not be able to achieve our noble objectives. We will redouble our eforts to grow the business across the region. We intend to achieve this through continued product innovation, re-engineering of our route to market, execution of cost containment initiatives in all functions, and digital transformation initiatives to improve business agility, fexibility and performance. Despite the continuing uncertainty in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bamburi Group has confdence in the ability of the two governments of Kenya and Uganda to help contain the pandemic and promote a positive economic environment supportive of business growth. We will compliment government eforts with continuing to fawlessly execute our “Building for Growth” strategy, while espousing the spirit of resilience in the Health, Cost and Cash initiative as has been demonstrated by our management team. BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 BAMBURI CEMENT ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 2020 OVERVIEW BUSINESS OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REVIEW 22 23 Setting Industry Standards in Health & Safety At the same time, our non-industrial staf worked from home, with our customer facing employees connecting and engaging with our customers virtually during the restricted period. As a business, we also played our part by lending fnancial support to government sponsored containment initiatives, as well as making donations of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and consumables such as sanitisers, to the community and healthcare workers in order to help curb the spread of the pandemic. Some of the policies we adopted as a Group in a bid to minimise the risk of spreading the virus, include; setting up of handwashing and sanitisation stations and temperature screening points at all access points into our sites, visualizing social distancing through markers within ofces and work stations, implementing disinfection schedules for commonly touched surfaces and high trafc areas, and strictly enforcing the wearing of masks. We also safely accommodated over 120 workers onsite following the Presidential directives to industrial operators during the Covid-19 restriction period. Safety Alongside the focus on health, the Group continued to prioritise safety. Year 2020 was a good year for Kenya, which registered signifcant improvement over 2019. There was only one Lost Time Incident (LTI) compared to four LTI’s in 2019 in our Mombasa Plant, and one medical injury in 2020 compared to four in 2019. Unfortunately and regrettably, we recorded one road fatality in 2020, same as in 2019. Our Mombasa plant was recognized in the whole of Middle East & Africa (MEA) region by the LafargeHolcim group for closing sustainably 100% of their audit fndings from the Health and Safety audit performed in 2019. This was achieved despite the disruption caused by the pandemic. The closure of these actions was confrmed through a verifcation audit performed in November 2020 by the LafargeHolcim Group Health & Safety team. Our Hima Cement Limited did even better in 2020. At Hima, we did not register any onsite fatality nor Lost Time Injury (LTI) as a result of our operations. Operational Review As a consequence of the pandemic, the Group revenue performance was adversely impacted in the frst half of the year when the containment measures were most strict. The measures included restriction of movements and shorter working hours due to lockdowns and curfews. Many construction sites and aggregates quarries were shut down in response. Following the easing of of the measures towards the second half, we started witnessing some recovery. As a consequence of the difcult frst half, our revenue declined by 13% in the period, while the second half of the year registered a growth of 3% compared to 2019. The Group performance in 2020 is very much a story of two halves. Overall, the full year registered a 5% decline in revenue. At Lafargeholcim, health and safety is our overarching value. We prioritise the health and safety of our employees, partners and our communities because we believe this is the most sustainable way to doing business. 2020 is a year that would bring this value to the test more than ever before. A year of major business disruption on account of the Covid-19 global pandemic. With the announcement of the initial cases in Kenya and Uganda in the month of March 2020, the two governments immediately embarked on containment measures to curb the spread of the pandemic. The Bamburi Group also responded swiftly by implementing the “HEALTH, COST & CASH” (HCC) action plan in order to protect the health of its stakeholders and that of the company. The objectives of the HCC initiative were threefold; ie • To prioritise the protection of human health and by extension, human life, • To preserve cash in the business, and • To optimize the Group’s cost base by deprioritizing non-critical and non-essential spends. Health The Covid-19 pandemic crisis, challenged us to innovate new and safe ways of doing business. For our employees, business Partners, stakeholders, and even the communities that we operate in, the priority was and remains, Health. Being an industrial outft, we had to have a signifcant number of our employees operating on site. Consequently, we had to incorporate safety measures, including compliance with the mandated protocols by the Ministries of Health of the two countries. All our operations, from quarry to logistics had to comply with stipulated containment measures in order to protect all that were involved. Despite the challenges experienced in 2020, we were still able to sustain the innovation momentum. Bamburi Cement Limited (BCL) launched ‘Fundi’ cement, a new MC 22.5, targeted at masonry and mortar works such as plastering, brick and block laying, screed and repair works. The new “Fundi” cement complements our wide range of existing product and building solution oferings targeting specifc applications such as structural and waterproofng works. The launch of Fundi cement demonstrates BCL’s commitment to providing innovative solutions that meet more specifc and unique construction and user needs. In both Kenya and Uganda, in the midst of the crisis, we launched a commercial digital platform, namely “Lead Retail” application. The objective of the application is to connect with our customers so that they can order online, track their orders and deliveries and check their accounts. In Uganda, this digital application was complemented by another one, known as “Jumia”. The objective of going digital is to expand our customer reach and online footprint by connecting directly with individual home builders (IHBs). As result, a total of 40 new customers were recruited into this digital platform during the year. These initiatives are part of our Route-To-Market re-engineering and are expected to drive brand penetration at the retail level and provide more sales opportunities. We expect the digital solutions to help us connect better with our customers while also helping us ofer a superior service to them. The timing of the digital solutions also served both our employees and customers well at a time when personal physical contact was to be minimized or eliminated altogether. Cost The “Cost” Pillar of the HCC agenda that was launched in response to the pandemic, enabled us to drive a cost saving agenda to mitigate the impact of decline in revenue on the bottomline. By deprioritizing non-critical and nonessential costs, the impact of revenue decline on bottomline was fully mitigated. The successful implementation of the “cost” pillar, enabled us to mitigate the adverse impact not only of the revenue decline, but also of the signifcant devaluation of Kenya Shilling in 2020 (by over 8%) on our imported cost base, as well as the negative impact of the exceptional impairment of our Biofuels asset (by Kes 352m) in the year. Cash The “Cash” pillar of the HCC initiative, which was about cash preservation to secure our liquidity; also served the Group well at a time of fnancial and cash distress for many businesses. To deliver on the Cash objective, the Group focused on inventory level optimization, and a tighter trade receivables governance which was supported by automation of the credit control process. As a consequence, The Group was rewarded with a record cash fow in a long time.

The HCC agenda will help us optimise our cost base in order to deliver proftable growth. In Kenya, we will continue to support the Government’s Big 4 Agenda, specifcally the construction of afordable housing and key infrastructure projects such as dams, ports, the expressway, bypasses and road interchanges. In Uganda we will also continue to focus on supplying key strategic projects in the domestic and export markets. The company will continue leveraging its brand equity for large projects, developing new products to penetrate new segments and gain market share in targeted markets through a more efcient commercial operation. Overall, the Group is optimistic that as it maximizes revenue opportunities and continues to drive transformation initiatives to optimise cost base, we are in a good position to create more value for all our stakeholders and shareholders in the short, medium and long term.

Cement Market & Competition Despite the sound economic growth, the Kenyan cement market recorded its second successive decline at 5% in 2018 in addition to the decline of 8.2% in 2017, with total decline of 13.6% compared to 2016. The decline was attributed to low private sector investment delays in Government disbursements for infrastructure projects. Overall cement market in Uganda grew by only an estimated 1% in 2018, behind GDP growth, despite stable interest rates in the economy, recovery in private sector and increase in public sector investment, in particular, the ramp up of key infrastructure projects. The Rwanda cement market grew at 7% in line with GDP. With excess cement grinding capacity in Kenya and Uganda, our regional market has remained competitive with price pressure across all segments. To counter this, we launched key commercial and customer excellence initiatives, which alongside our product quality and strong brand position, enabled us to grow our leadership position across the region.

We also expect that the market will be spurred by the Government’s Big 4 Agenda push towards H?VYKHISLOV\ZPUNHUK\USVJRPUNVMM\UKZMVYPUMYHZ[Y\J[\YL development. As a result of these, and following two years of market decline, we expect a market growth in Kenya of 2-3% in 2019. Uganda GDP is expected to be fuelled by increase in infrastructure spending, especially to support the oil industry, and agriculture. The cement market is expected to grow in line with the economy. Beyond 2019, we expect Kenya and Uganda to both achieve cement growth rates above GDP, as is the norm for maturing countries. In addition, we expect growth in the inland export markets of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Rwanda.

The Group will continue to optimize on its route to market strategy, cost to serve, innovative product mix and customizing solutions to the customers. “The Group is well positioned to exploit opportunities in the next phase of our growth” The report covers Bamburi Cement Limited (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’). The East African economies covering the key markets of Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda expanded at an estimated 5%, mainly supported by rebound in tourism, supportive monetary policy and ongoing infrastructure investments despite the negative impact of increasing global oil prices. The Kenyan economy was further suppressed by lower agricultural output impacted by drought and prolonged pre/ post-election period. In Kenya interest rates were fairly stable with maximum interest rates pegged at 4% plus the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) policy rate. While in Uganda as part of efforts to stimulate the economy, the Bank of Uganda policy rate reduced to 9.5% from 12% in December 2016. However, this only had a marginal effect on the lending rates. The exchange rates remained fairly stable during that period in both countries. The governments of the East African Community (EAC) remained focused on their development agenda with continued investment in infrastructure across the region, which is expected to continue in the medium term to long term period. Cement Market & Competition Cement growth was depressed in Kenya with an estimated decline of 8% compared to prior year as a result of economic slowdown attributed to drought, decreasing private sector credit and prolonged election period. However, Uganda and Rwanda recorded a 3% market growth rate supported by stable macroeconomic environments, while inland Africa export market of the Democratic Republic of Congo remained buoyant. The market remained very competitive with installed cement capacity in Kenya and Uganda reflecting a 25% and 12% over capacity respectively. However, both markets have clinker under capacity. Despite the cement over capacity, the Group remained ahead of the competition through its efforts of providing differentiated and innovative solutions to customers together while bolstering the route to market in both countries, exploring new markets and innovative product solutions. To enhance operating margin in this competitive landscape, the Group continued with its prudent cost control, enhanced operations efficiency and continuous productivity improvement. BAMBURI CEMENT 7 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Investing in the Future The Group is on course to operationalize the capacity expansion projects in both Kenya and Uganda by July 2018, which will increase cement capacity by 1.7mt (million tons) at an approximate cost of Shs 8.3 billion. This investment is expected to consolidate the Group’s regional growth strategy in Kenya and Uganda while expanding to emerging markets of Southern Sudan, Rwanda, and Eastern DR Congo. The Group is in advance studies on embarking on Phase 2 of this expansion that aims to solidify our position as the least cost producer in the region. The Group continues to focus on vertical integration by enhancing the capacity of ready mix business across Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda with launch of the ready mix operations in Rwanda in 2017 to better serve the growing market with construction solutions. Performance Review Following market slowdown in Kenya, increased competition and cement overcapacity, the Group turnover decreased by 6% to Shs 35.9 billion despite continued leverage on strong brands, innovative product offerings across the segments, a strong sales force drive for market excellence and unparalleled customer service. Profit before tax decreased by 50% to Shs 4.1 billion driven by decline in total turnover, an unfavourable cost environment on the energy costs and other input prices, against the backdrop of a challenging competitive and operating environment. The Group will continue to focus relentlessly on cost rationalization, industrial productivity improvements and in delighting its customers with innovative solutions. In 2017, the Group paid Shs 3.1 billion to its shareholders as dividends. In addition to this, the Group paid corporation taxes to the respective governments amounting to Shs 1.6 billion in addition to the indirect taxes like VAT and duties. 2018 Outlook 2018 has started well and the Group remains optimistic that this will persist despite rising global fuel prices, recent civil tensions in the eastern DRC and rising power prices in Kenya. The Group remains confident that the inherent strength of its business and well balanced brand portfolio, complimented by a well-equipped human talent pool, will support the deliverance of continued shareholder value. We expect the market to remain highly competitive with resultant price pressures. The Group will continue to optimize on its route to market strategy, cost to serve, innovative product mix and customizing solutions to the customers. Key focus will be the successful entry of the new capacity volumes into the market and redesign of product sourcing to improve customer offering and maximize gains from the new plants. Key risks in 2018 will be civil unrest in eastern DRC, a core export market, and higher energy prices for coal and power especially in Kenya. Appreciation The Group owes a debt of gratitude to all its shareholders, the Board of Directors, Management and staff for guiding the Group during a very difficult and challenging year while re-positioning the Group to meet emerging challenges during the next phase of its growth. This was an extraordinary year that made extraordinary demands on the Group. There can be no doubt that the Group’s resilience is testament to the indomitable spirit and capability of its staff. The Group’s momentum is good notwithstanding uncertainty in operating conditions; we see and will exploit opportunity in a challenging business environment. The Board is the confident that the Group has the leadership and the people to exploit these opportunities to the best advantage of its shareholders and stakeholders. Dr John P. N. Simba, OGW, MBS, EGH Chairman 26 March 2018 8 2017 HIGHLIGHTS Group Managing Director Statement We anticipate a stable macroeconomic environment and continued government spend in infrastructure which will be instrumental in stimulating cement growth in the region. We take cognizance of increased competitive operating environment and will strive to develop and implement suitable strategies to drive growth and profitability. “The Group remained resilient despite a highly competitive and challenging operating environment.” This is my first report as the Managing Director since my appointment on 9 February 2018. I am privileged to be joining a great Group (Bamburi Cement Limited and its subsidiaries) with great brands, highly trained and motivated people, situated in a region of great growth potential. Whereas the report below is not related to the period that I have been with the Group and the Company, I have been quickly brought abreast of the Group and the Company performance, positives and challenges of 2017 in this region. Overall, the Group continued to demonstrate resilience and maintain its market leadership position in a highly competitive and challenging operating environment in the region across the different business segments. We continue with our resolve in providing unparalleled construction solutions for sustainable infrastructure development and building better cities in the region. Health and Safety Safety remains our number one priority with a zero harm objective in all our operations. It is with great sadness that I report that we had one road accident that resulted in 4 fatalities in Kenya that involved a third party transporter and a passenger vehicle in Kenya. In addition, in Uganda we had 2 accidents, resulting in one fatality involving third party transporters and motorcycle taxi operators (Boda Bodas), highlighting the increased risk of Boda Bodas on our roads. We undertook a thorough review of the circumstances that resulted in these fatalities and we have undertaken various measures to reinforce our safety culture within our operations and throughout the supply chain to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of those who work for us, those who do business with us and for the community at large. We have also intensified defensive driving for all our third party road transporter drivers, including re-training and re-examining all our defensive driving trainers and improving awareness of the increased Boda Boda risk. Capacity enhancement We are at advanced stages of completing the capacity increase projects in both Kenya and Uganda and we look forward to a timely completion of the projects by July 2018. The commencement of Phase 1 capacity increase investment decision signals our confidence in the region and underscores our belief of the projected and continued growth in all East African economies, underpinned by a robust construction industry and the growing demand for cement and cement related products. We are also completing studies on the phase 2 of the capacity expansion project which will increase our clinker capacity and allow us maintain our cost leadership position in the region. BAMBURI CEMENT 9 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 In conclusion I would like to appreciate all our stakeholders, loyal customers, service providers, regional governments and talented staff for their invaluable resilience, contribution and collaborative engagement in the year. We will continue to rely on all of them for their support as we strive to cement our market leadership position. Seddiq Hassani Group Managing Director 26 March 2018 Operational and financial performance The Group demonstrated strong resilience in a very competitive and challenging operating environment impacted by unstable macroeconomic environment especially in Kenya. We however continued to leverage on our unique and innovative construction solutions offering to the market geared by our talented workforce to achieve a turnover of Shs 35.9 billion in the year, 6% lower than prior period. Operating profit for the year declined by 47% to Shs 4.2 billion largely driven by a decline in our turnover with lower volumes coupled with an unfavourable external cost environment. On the other hand, we continued to have a steady growth in our contractor segment and positive results on an aggressive cost containment strategy in our operations. We continue leveraging our talented and dedicated work force and support from our parent Company LafargeHolcim in optimizing all our business processes. The Group dividend and tax payments in the year declined proportionally to our performance. We continue with our mandate to support the countries we operate in through our tax payments and creating and capturing value for all our stakeholders. Our Cash resources for the year declined to Shs 2.0 billion mainly on account of lower operating profit from Kenya coupled by cash injection into the capacity increase projects in both Kenya and Uganda. Outlook for 2018 We anticipate a stable macroeconomic environment and continued government spend in infrastructure which will be instrumental in stimulating cement growth in the region. We take cognizance of increased competitive operating environment and will strive to develop and implement suitable strategies to drive growth and profitability. The Group will focus on maintaining a superior product offering to the market through innovation anchored on stellar customer service. The group will continue leveraging on our commercial transformation through our enhanced route to market and the recently introduced retail franchise network, Binastore and Bonastore in Kenya and Uganda respectively. We shall leverage our industrial operation excellence to create value for our customers while generating profitability for our shareholders. We are firm in our resolve to continue being the market leader in the cement industry in the region. The Group will increase its efficiency through rational cost containment measures and value driven capital expenditure while maintaining our overarching health and safety obligations and environmental stewardship responsibilities. We intend to obtain all the above while optimizing our working capital to generate strong cash from our operations. 2 OUR BUSINESS BAMBURI CEMENT 11 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 What we do POWERMAX a 42.5 grade blended cement that offers superior strength for use in building, civil and structural works.

Shs Million 10 11 2016 HIGHLIGHTS OUR BUSINESS OUR OPERATIONS SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDERS’ INFORMATION Chairman’s Statement “The Group is well positioned to benefit from the regional growth ambitions in Eastern Africa” The East African economies covering our key markets of Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda expanded at a healthy rate of 6% in 2016. The growth was mainly supported by low global oil prices, improved agricultural output, rebound in tourism, supportive monetary policy and ongoing infrastructure investments. In Kenya, interest rates were fairly high in the first nine months of the year but reduced in the fourth quarter following introduction of the interest rate capping law in August setting maximum interest rates at 4% above the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) policy rate. In Uganda, interest rates reduced after the Bank of Uganda policy rate closed at 12% versus 17% in December 2015, with a corresponding effect on the bank lending rates. Looking forward, the implementation of the East African Community (EAC) Northern Corridor Integration Projects Initiatives covering Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda, aimed at enhancing integration and the flow of trade between the EAC member states, is expected to result in increased infrastructure expenditure in these countries. Cement market & competition At growth rates of 6%-9% the cement market in East Africa continued to perform above GDP growth rates, driven by increased government expenditure on infrastructural projects in addition to robust Individual Home Builders (IHB) consumption. However, a slowdown in private investment in Kenya was noted in the second half of 2016. The market remains very competitive with up to 25% and 12% over capacity in installed cement capacity in Kenya and Uganda respectively, though there is a deficit in clinker capacity in both countries. Despite this, we have remained ahead of the market through our efforts of providing differentiated and innovative solutions to customers, bolstering our route to market in both Kenya and Uganda, while exploring for new markets and product solutions. To maintain our operating margin in this competitive landscape, the Group continued with its prudent cost management measures, enhanced operations efficiency and continuous productivity improvement. Investing in our future In August 2016, the Group announced investment in Phase 1 of a capacity expansion project in both Kenya and Uganda, which will increase cement capacity by 1.7MT at an approximate cost of Shs 8.3 billion. This investment is expected to consolidate our regional growth strategy in Kenya and Uganda while expanding to emerging markets of Southern Sudan, Rwanda, and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We are in advance studies for Phase 2 of this expansion that aims to solidify our position as the lowest cost producer in the region. The Group continues to focus on vertical integration by enhancing the capacity of ready mix and precast businesses across Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda with Ready Mix operations in Rwanda commissioned during the year. Financial Performance Review The financial year under review was characterized by increased competition amplified by excess cement production capacity across the region. Despite this, our revenue stood at Shs 38.0 billion (2015: 39.2 billion)supported by strong brands, efficient logistics, and innovative product offerings across the segments together with a strong sales force drive for market excellence and unparalleled customer service. Our operating profits increased by 8% to Shs 7.9 billion driven by stable sales revenues, our cost management measures, a tight focus on the energy costs and other input prices, and realisation of Plant efficiency projects both in Kenya and Uganda against the backdrop of a very challenging competitive and operating environment. Our robust balance sheet and liquidity position provides the support necessary to pursue new investment opportunities that will deliver shareholder growth. In all our business lines, we have put in place strategies that seek both to address existing challenges and to seize opportunities to strengthen our platform for the future. In 2016, the Group made a cash payment of Shs 4.7 billion to its shareholders as dividends. Further, the Group paid corporation taxes to the respective governments amounting to Shs 3.5 billion in addition to indirect taxes like VAT and duties. Through payment of these taxes coupled with employment creation, the Group is assisting the countries in which we operate to deliver on their development agenda. 2017 Outlook The Eastern African economies are expected to grow though with various uncertainties, key among them being the rising global fuel prices and dry weather conditions in major parts of Kenya and Uganda. While aware of the potential challenges ahead, the Group remains confident that the inherent strength of its business and well balanced brand portfolio, complimented by a well equipped human talent pool, will enhance the Group’s resilience to ensure continued delivery of shareholder and stakeholder value. We are committed to deepening our relationships with our customers and key partners in delivering innovative construction solutions. We will continue to focus relentlessly on cost rationalization, industrial productivity improvements, and in delighting our customers with innovative solutions. Appreciation I wish to thank my colleagues on the Board for their vision and input in the Board deliberations. I would also like to thank all employees for their relentless commitment that continued to yield exemplary results. I commend the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda together with our business partners, whose appreciated support was the backbone of the Group’s success. Finally, on behalf of the Board, Management and employees, I wish to pass the Group’s sincere gratitude to all the shareholders for their continued confidence in the Group. Dr. John Simba, OGW, MBS Chairman 12 13 2016 HIGHLIGHTS OUR BUSINESS OUR OPERATIONS SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDERS’ INFORMATION The Group once again cemented its regional market leadership by posting impressive financial results across the different business segments. This is a clear demonstration of our resolve in providing unparalleled construction solutions towards supporting the greater East African Region to Build Better through sustainable infrastructure, better housing and better cities. Health and safety The Group continues to focus on its zero harm policy. In 2016, we continued to improve on our global safety performance and indicators. However, we unfortunately recorded two LTIs (Lost Time Injuries) in Kenya at the Mombasa Plant and one at the Nairobi Grinding Plant. In addition, we had one medical injury at the Mombasa Plant. In Kenya, we implemented the Reward and Sanction policy across all the sites supported by the Health and Safety passport. By the end of the year, we had a total of 30 employees and contractors rewarded in the various months for their outstanding contribution in Health and Safety. We also rolled out Health and Safety Leadership training for Managers in the year and enhanced our Health and Safety performance through cross functional plant and site audits. The road safety performance was boosted by journey management and trucks inspections while driver behavior improved with monitoring through road patrols, global position systems (GPS) and a newly introduced driver’s league matrix. In Health, we ran a number of initiatives at the Kenya plants and sites to improve employees’ wellbeing. Many projects were implemented to reduce fugitive dust emissions, reduce noise in the plant and improve ergonomics at the plants and office settings. In Uganda, we established an online training center on Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) for staff and contractors. The facility enables users to achieve at least twelve hours of online HSE training on diverse topics including noise at work, waste management, work at height, lifting operations among others. We hosted several activities with our key stakeholders aimed at increasing awareness on major health and safety topics including hosting an event on the global health and safety day. Innovatively, we hosted a health and safety event for our closest stakeholders, our employee’s spouses and dependants with the aim of raising awareness and strengthening employee engagement Capacity enhancement We have commenced work on our Phase 1 capacity increment project, the contractor is on site, and excavation work is in progress in both Kenya and Uganda. We look forward to a timely completion of the project by the middle of 2018. The commencement of this Phase focusing on increasing cement production capacity signals our confidence in the region and underscores our belief in the projected and continued growth of all the East African economies, underpinned by a robust construction industry with an expected rise in the demand for cement and cement related products. We are performing detailed studies to enable us embark very quickly, on Phase 2 of the capacity expansion, that would allow us to increase our clinker capacity and maintain our cost leadership position in the region. Operational and financial performance The Group demonstrated strong resilience in a very competitive and challenging operating environment, bolstered by our unique and innovative construction solutions offering to the market, geared by our highly talented workforce. In 2016, we achieved a turnover of Shs 38.0 billion (2015: Shs 39.2 billion). The Group continues to delight customers by providing effective construction solutions in the most efficient manner through a dedicated and effective sales force, supported by an optimal production process and improved logistics solutions. In 2016, as part of our Commercial Transformation Strategy, we embarked on a Route to Market initiative. This will allow the Group to have better control of the distribution of our products and ensure that these products are available where they are required by our customers. We shall continue to embark on the implementation of this initiative and shall build on collaborations between our marketing, sales, plant and logistics teams to continue delighting our customers. Operating profit for the year increased by 8%, to Shs 7.9 billion, driven by public sector investment, a steady growth in the infrastructure and contractor segment, lower cost base due to better plant and logistics efficiencies, in addition to a favorable external cost environment. The Group continues to benefit from a dedicated and talented workforce and to leverage support from the Group’s parent company, LafargeHolcim, in optimizing the production process in terms of output, cost and quality of end products and solutions. The Group’s profit before tax declined by 2% to Shs 8.3 billion mainly as a result of lower exchange gains on foreign currency denominated cash. I am delighted to note that while we have steadily increased our dividend payments to our shareholders to Shs 4.7 billion, we also increased our direct corporation tax payments to the governments of the countries we operate, from Shs 2.5 billion to Shs 3.5 billion. “The Group continues to deliver strong results cementing its resilience in a competitive environment.’’ The Group Managing Director’s Statement 14 The Group Managing Director Statement (continued) This is in addition to the increase in other indirect tax payments like Value Added Tax and Customs Duties that increased proportionally. This is testament to our contribution to the tax revenue growth of the countries we operate in, as we continue to create and capture value in the region. Our cash resources declined to Shs 7.0 billion due to the increased dividends and tax payments. At the same time, we paid out cash for the capacity increase project mobilization, while we invested in working capital at the year end, to prepare ourselves for an anticipated market growth in the first half of 2017. Outlook for 2017 In 2017, we expect a continuation of the 6% to 9% economic growth in our markets, that is Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda and in our export markets of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This will in turn drive the growth in cement and cement related products. The Group takes cognizance of increased competitive environment in this region and continues to develop and implement suitable strategies to drive the Group’s growth and profitability. The Group strategy in this environment is anchored on four strategic pillars of Commercial Excellence, Cost Leadership, Value Creating Capital Expenditure and Sustainability, driven by agility in everything we do, collaboration through working better as teams and empowerment of our talented people. The Group will anchor on its Commercial Transformation strategy, to focus on maintaining a superior offering to the market through innovation secured by stellar customer service and a highly skilled, trained and effective sales work force. The Group shall continue to rollout the Route to Market initiative across the region, to ensure that customers from all locations of the region have access to our high quality construction solutions, at the optimal cost of delivery. Further, the Group will increase its efficiency through rational cost containment to maintain and improve its cost leadership position in the region, though the active support of the Group’s Technical Partners, LafargeHolcim. The Group will continue to invest in value driven capital expenditure, aimed at increasing productivity. The delivery of construction solutions to our customers will be done in a sustainable manner as the Group continues to enforce its Sustainability strategy to ensure a better tomorrow for all stakeholders. As we achieve all these, the Group will continue to aggressively implement its overarching value of Health and Safety to ensure that it is soundly embedded in all our operations, be it at our Plants, all our sites, on the road and in the market place. All the above will not be achieved without our people. The Group shall continue to attract and retain the best people, develop and train them, and give them the best opportunities to excel for both themselves and the wider Group. In Conclusion The Group appreciates all its stakeholders, its loyal customers, service providers, regional governments and staff for their invaluable support and contribution in the year. The Group will continue to rely on this support as it continues to delight customers with construction solutions and towards helping the East African Region Build Better, while creating Sustainable value for all Stakeholders.

Government spending on infrastructure and housing in the region has also spurred demand for cement. Kenya The market grew ahead of GDP following recovery in the infrastructure segment as a result of good public investment, the trickle-down effects of infrastructure expansion on Individual Home Builders (IHB) segment activity, an increase in diaspora remittances and a stable macro-economic environment further stimulating demand. Uganda The market grew ahead of the GDP growth rate supported by recovery in the infrastructure segment as a result of good public investment as well as rising credit growth driven by robust private consumption and improvement in IHB activity. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Capacities continued to grow at rates above the growth in demand, putting pressure on prices The Kenya and Uganda markets remain in a clinker manufacturing deficit and cement surplus in the short run, however the group’s markets extend to larger Eastern and Inland Africa markets which are in a cement-deficit position Progressive excellence in cost optimisation with a key focus on energy costs, which are a key component of our cost of production Continued focus on vertical integration activities, enhanced route to market, channel partner programmes, brand building and innovation to grow revenues Outlook Risks Opportunities • Geopolitical tensions • Security concerns • Currency and commodities risks • Current stability of the geopolitical climate • Stable macro-economic indicators • Greater East African Community integration • Favourable weather and fuel prices KE TZ UG RW BU 12 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 I take great pleasure as the Chairman of Bamburi Cement Limited in presenting another year of great success. It has been an exciting year for the country and the region. In Kenya we have seen the devolved government take shape with a more inclusive form of governance now in place. County governments have rolled out various development projects whose benefits are now starting to be felt at grassroots level. We have seen growth in all our home markets of Kenya and Uganda and a recovery of our export inland African markets, as the peace dividend in eastern DR Congo starts bearing fruit. 2014 was historic for Kenya as the country floated its first ever sovereign Eurobond of US$ 2bn that was oversubscribed by 400%. This strongly signals increased investor confidence and the future outlook of the country as a regional business hub. The Kenyan government continued to put more focus on bilateral cooperation with Asian partners especially China. The national government made further significant investments in public infrastructure, notably in power, roads, ports and railways. Likewise in Uganda, we are also seeing significant government investment in infrastructure projects with more focus on power and roads. Such projects in both our main countries of operation, have opened up new opportunities for economic growth and productivity among various industry sectors such as ours. The macro-economic environment in Kenya has been favourable with GDP growth estimated at 5.2% compared to 5.7% in 2013 (rebased). Annual inflation dropped to 6.9% while exchange rates were relatively stable. The benchmark interest rate as set by the regulator (Central Bank of Kenya) remained at 8.5% for the better part of the year. In Uganda, we also experienced high GDP growth rates of 5.7% supported by growth in public infrastructure and relatively stable single digit inflation at 2.7%. The benchmark interest rate remained at 11% for the better part of the year. On an industry level, the cement sector grew above the GDP growth rates in our markets of operation (Kenya and Uganda). This was driven by a stable macroeconomic environment, which has supported good individual home builder (IHB) performance. Another contributor has been increased government expenditure in large public infrastructure projects in the oil industry, transportation and construction centred around publicprivate partnerships (PPPs). CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Committed to the development of the region 13 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT All these factors have played in favour of our company and provided opportunities for us to not only grow our business, but also push ourselves to provide more innovative products that suit the sophisticated construction needs of our wide range of customers. We are fully committed to continuously growing shareholder value. We have increased our EPS by 3% to Kshs 9.80. The Board has proposed a dividend payout of Kshs 4.4bn which translates into a 9% increase in dividend per share to Kshs.12. At Bamburi, we are not only focused on financial performance, but also on building a sustainable business that will continue to generate value for all stakeholders into the foreseeable future. Our priority areas have remained safety, health and environment in ensuring sustainable and profitable operations across all the regions we operate in. The initiatives we deployed throughout the year include increased staff participation in making our operations safe: involving our suppliers and distributors in making our environment safe especially on our roads; and applying strict global standards to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. Clean energy and efficient operations remains an area we have a keen interest in. We invested in key projects during the year to drive energy efficiency throughout our production process and we entrench our resolve to be a socially and environmentally responsible corporate citizen. Future outlook There are several factors that we believe will promote growth in the cement industry in the mid-term. One, we anticipate further global economic growth and improved regional demand. Two, economic integration within the East Africa Countries will deepen even further. Three, regional governments have “The East African region continues to experience dynamic growth propagated by increased investment interest and large scale development projects in the member countries. A growing population and increased spending power has generated more demand for quality and affordable housing solutions. New markets are opening up as a result of regional integration and co-operation. This presents unique opportunities for Bamburi to continue on its growth trajectory and play an even bigger role in the region’s development agenda but more importantly; to do so in a sustainable manner” Current and Prospective Key Projects in the region KENYA UGANDA Standard gauge railway Entebbe-Kampala express road Lamu Port 600MW Karuma dam JKIA expansion and greenfield 185MW Isimba dam 500km of road on PPP Jinja Nile bridge LAPSET East Africa Railway Network committed to investing more in infrastructure in both the public and private sectors. Lastly, the maturation of county government structures and systems in Kenya will translate into increased spending on local development projects. Of course, there are some challenges that we are monitoring such as the reliability, sufficiency and quality of power supply. As the largest power consumer in both Kenya and Uganda, this is critical to us. Political stability and security which impact on our supply and distribution network, our operations and the welfare of our employees, are also very important considerations. Going forward, market competition is bound to increase with the opening up of more growth opportunities in the region. Bamburi Cement Limited takes full cognisance of these factors and we intend to leverage our regional presence, global brand association and international expertise to take our business to the next level. Through cutting edge research and innovation we believe we have what it takes to be a truly customer-centric business, one that provides not only the best products, but also the right construction solutions to meet its customers’ needs. We will continue to engage with our stakeholders especially in the provision of reliable and stable power to ensure more efficient production and operations in our plants. We are excited about the Kenyan national government’s continued commitment to an improved power generation mix. Greater focus will be put on the execution of our strategic goals as well as our uncompromising stand when it comes to health and safety. In conclusion, I would like to thank my board and management team for their exemplary performance in ensuring another year of success at Bamburi. Dr John P.N. Simba, OGW, MBS CHAIRMAN 14 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 INTERVIEW WITH THE MANAGING DIRECTOR What type of year did the group experience? 2014 was a mixed bag of results. Our markets in the region have continued to grow but we have not fully benefited from the same. At the same time, our cost of production was impacted by inflationary pressures to key inputs. That said, we made good progress in improving our operational performance and building sustainable operations across our markets. Of special note are the changes we made to the key management team as well as the provision of increased autonomy to the Hima management team, which will help increase efficiency in decision making. What are some of the highlights of the year? As a business, we are concerned about much more than just profitability. Personally, I am very proud of our achievements in health and safety. We made good progress in road safety culture entrenchment with zero fatalities on the roads. We also achieved zero fatalities across our industrial sites though we recorded two Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) in the period. There has also been significant improvement in organisational engagement in promoting health and safety in the work environment. On another aspect, our Mombasa plant was audited externally by Lafarge Group against the Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) and registered a performance of 2.6 against a target of 3.0 which is highly impressive. On the commercial side, we have been striving to reinforce our customer focus. In addition, Bamburi invested in its brand and drove innovation in the cement industry in the region. While capitalising on our brand, we launched and commenced production of POWERCRETE, which is a high end product, first of its kind in East Africa, and which has stringent production requirements and is being used in major infrastructure projects in the region such as the Standard Gauge Railway. We have also rolled out sales force training to bolster sales productivity and effectiveness with a focus on customer relationship management. We have also prepared the launch of new products for roads in 2015. Any challenges you faced in 2014? Competition has been on the increase with the market now having nine players across Kenya and Uganda and this has kept our prices under pressure. The increased costs of operations especially high power costs has added more pressure on our margins. Despite these constraints, we still managed to produce a robust set of results based on our ability to innovate and anticipate future construction needs. Committed to delighting customers with innovative solutions 15 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 INTERVIEW WITH THE MANAGING DIRECTOR How about bottom-line performance? I am proud of the continuous efforts of my entire team in ensuring another good year for the company and its shareholders. We posted growth in most of our key financial metrics. Turnover went up by Kshs 2.1bn to Kshs 36.0bn due to better performance in Uganda and a growth in domestic volumes of 2% and export volumes of 22%. Pre-tax profit grew by Kshs 285mn to Kshs 5.8bn mainly due to the recovery of domestic market prices in Uganda as well as market growth across the region. Our costs went up by 6% due to increased production and the challenges mentioned earlier. We put a number of cost containment measures into place. First, we increased alternate fuels substitution across the sites and completed the heavy fuel oil to petcoke conversion in Uganda. Secondly, we implemented actions around sustaining operational efficiency in energy consumption, usage of raw materials and increase the production of clinker. Thirdly, we renegotiated key contracts to achieve lower operating costs. Our cash position also reduced by Kshs 1.2bn to Kshs 7.6bn after the 2013 dividend payout and loan repayments made in the year and we have now fully repaid the loan taken for the expansion in Hima. What can we look forward to in 2015? The industry will definitely become more competitive and at the same time our customers will develop more sophisticated needs and tastes. We see this as an opportunity to leverage on our strengths: our market leadership position, strong brands, geographical coverage, improved customer service as well as skilled and motivated teams. These will generate value for all stakeholders and drive the bottom line. Collaboration with all our stakeholders across a broad base of agendas will see us establish a sustainable business for the mutual benefit of all parties. We will put more focus on our customers, new products, new services, focused attention on their needs will be at the heart of our preoccupation. As an example, we have made great headway into setting up our affordable housing agenda and in the coming year will be launching our pilot initiative. This will combine access to construction funding via a microfinance partnership, provide construction technical assistance, link the borrowers to our network of reliable and convenient retailers of building materials, and provide access to alternative construction technologies Proactively positioning the company to the evolution in the markets remains a key focus area for us. We will continue to mitigate inflationary cost risks through continuous improvement in plant and logistical efficiencies. Some of the key projects planned for 2015 include process optimisation for better energy consumption and increased alternate fuels substitution across sites. Anything you would like to say in parting? I would like to extend my appreciation to our customers for their brand loyalty over the years; to our suppliers and distributors for reinforcing our business operation; to my staff for their dedication and resilience; and to the governments, the communities we operate in and other stakeholders for their continued collaborative engagement with us. Bruno Pescheux MANAGING DIRECTOR Committed to delighting customers with innovative solutions “We are operating in an ever increasingly competitive environment with more discerning customers who demand for customised construction solutions. It becomes crucial for Bamburi to continuously identify the intrinsic customer needs and address them through innovative and affordable solutions that improve their quality of life.” 16 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 OUR BUSINESS IN REVIEW OUR BUSINESS IN REVIEW MORE BEAUTIFUL 17 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 OUR BUSINESS IN REVIEW 18 BAMBURI CEMENT LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 WHAT WE DO Cement • POWERMAX - a 42.5 grade blended cement that offers superior strength for use in building, civil and structural works. • POWERCRETE - a 52.5 grade cement made in conformance to Chinese standards to meet requirements for special projects such as the Standard Railway project. • NGUVU - a 32.5 grade cement used for general building and structural works. • SUPASET - a 32.5 grade cement and for general building and structural works (Export brand). • MULTIPURPOSE - a 32.5 grade cement used for general building and structural works. • POWERPLUS - a 42.5 grade pure cement used for high strength concrete.

The Company has three subsidiaries namely Hima Cement Limited, Bamburi Special Products Limited and Lafarge Eco Systems Limited. Bamburi Cement started as a subsidiary of Cementia Holding A.G. in 1951 and its first fully integrated plant in Mombasa officially opened in 1954. The initiation of its world renowned quarry rehabilitation program in Mombasa began in 1972. As an industry captain and leading cement producer, it opened a grinding plant in Athi River near Nairobi in 1998 and thereafter, acquired Hima Cement Ltd in Kasese, Uganda in 1999. Throughout the Company’s legacy of 60 years of cement manufacture and innovation in East Africa, and backed by Lafarge’s 180 years of expertise, their brands have commanded leadership in all the markets they operate in. It is the only integrated one-stop shop for all cement and concrete solutions with a clear dedication to sustainability. Hima Cement has over the years undergone tremendous transformation in terms of output, operational and human resource capability. Today the new Hima cement factory located in Kasese – Western Uganda, has the capacity to produce 850,000 tons cement per annum up from 170,000 tons. As with all Lafarge plants, Hima operates under stringent quality control processes and has over the last decade built a reputation of being the Ugandan cement manufacturer that produces consistently high quality cement products. Bamburi Special Products was launched in 1998 to stimulate growth in the concrete market. It pioneered development of concrete paving solutions and shifted market consumption patterns from Asphalt to Concrete. The Company has revolutionized the concrete industry and has rapidly grown in its two divisions - Concrete Paving Blocks and Ready Mix Concrete. Today Bamburi Special Products is the largest supplier of Ready Mix Concrete and Precast Blocks in Kenya. Lafarge Eco Systems, the environmental and rehabilitation division of the Company was set up in 1971, as Bamburi Nature Trails. It is mandated to manage all mining reserve land, rehabilitate exhausted quarries as well as sustainably utilize the rehabilitated quarries. Since inception Lafarge Eco Systems has restored numerous quarries and won international acclaim and awards for its rehabilitation work as well as for best practices. Today the Company owns and manages world class nature and environmental parks developed from rehabilitated quarries.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP The Group remained committed to conducting its operations as a responsible corporate citizen in all the countries within East Africa in which it operates. The Board and I take safety, health and environment as our number one priority in guaranteeing sustainable profitable operations for all stakeholders. Focus has continued on greater people involvement in making all our operations safe, increased involvement with stakeholders to create a safe operating environment especially on the roads and applying strict global environment standards to make sure that we minimize any effect on our environment. Despite all our efforts, it is with great regret that I report a road fatality in Uganda involving a contracted transporter that resulted WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION 8 Bamburi Cement Annual Report 2013 Chairman’s Statement in the death of Yosam Mugenyi, who was the driver of the truck. On behalf of the entire Group, I express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of our departed team member. Together with the Board and the Management, we will continue to focus on road safety which has proved to be a challenging aspect of our business. Given the large number of vehicles used diversely in our business, we shall continue to partner with authorities and other stakeholders to implement measures aimed at eliminating or significantly reducing road incidents. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The year enjoyed relatively stable macro economic conditions witnessing a real GDP growth rate estimate of 4.8% in Kenya and 5.8% in Uganda, compared to 4.5% and 3.6% prior year in Kenya and Uganda respectively. Average annual inflation in Kenya fell to 7.2% from 9.4% in 2012 while in Uganda, average annual inflation was 5.8% compared to 14% in 2012. In addition, the local currencies of both Kenya and Uganda were fairly stable at KShs. 86/US$ and UGX 2500/US$. Interest rates in both countries reduced with the Central Bank policy rate averaging at 8.8% and 11.7% compared to 16.5% and 23%in 2012 in Kenya and Uganda respectively. The actual commercial bank lending rates ranged at 8 - 12 percentage points above Central Bank policy rates. The gap between the Central Bank policy rate and the commercial bank lending rates indicates that there is room for bank lending rates to reduce, which would spur further growth in the construction and cement industry. Although both Government officials and business have repeatedly expressed concern that high interest rates will continue to discourage access to credit with inevitable slowdown of economic growth, not much was done to bring down the rates. During the year, however, there was a slowdown in both Kenya and Uganda, in government funded infrastructure projects, but we expect this to recover in 2014. MARKET CONDITIONS The overall cement market in Kenya grew by 4%, 2% behind 2012, driven by the market contraction in the first half of the year due to elections, however there was a recovery in second half mainly in the Individual Home Builders (IHB) segment, resulting from stable macro-economic indicators, notwithstanding the slowdown in Government funded projects in the same period. In Uganda the domestic cement market grew by 11%, driven by growth in the Individual Home Builders (IHB) and infrastructure segments, compared to 2012. The market, however, witnessed significant erosion in margin value mainly attributable to competitive pressure. The inland Africa export market reduced following civil instability in those markets. PERFORMANCE During the year, performance was negatively affected by a slow first half and low infrastructure expenditure in Kenya together with market positioning costs and significantly lower inland Africa exports out of Uganda. Turnover declined by KShs. 3.6 billion to KShs. 33.9 billion following a reduction of domestic and export sales by 5.2% and 27% respectively. Pre-tax profit declined to KShs 5.6 billion, 22% behind prior year, while earnings per share at KShs. 9.55 per share were 21% behind 2012. Despite the reduction in turnover, the Group generated sufficient cash during the period to enable it maintain its 2012 cash position. Group costs improved in the period due to lower consumption of purchased clinker after the improvements made at the Mombasa Plant, in the last quarter of 2012. In Kenya, the favorable weather conditions resulted in relatively stable power tariffs compared to 2012, until December when tariffs increased by approximately 12%. In Uganda, poor power quality and rationing continued to cause disruption to plant operations. As part of its cost containment measures, the Group continued to increase the level of alternative fuel substitution as well as diversification with different streams of alternative fuels. In addition, the Group undertook a KShs. 487 million project that would allow use of Petcoke in Uganda, with mill commissioning scheduled for the first quarter of 2014. Use of Petcoke in place of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) would result in a significant reduction in energy costs. Other projects completed in the year include the installation of a KShs. 275 Million bag filter in Uganda to support our global environmental ambitions 60 years of Building Cities 9 on dust emissions. The coffee seedling project in Kasese and Kamwenge Districts of Uganda continued with 10.7 million coffee seedlings planted. Harvesting is expected to commence in 2014 thereby providing the resulting husks as biofuel. OUTLOOK The implementation of the Constitution in Kenya will come with attendant challenges and opportunities. The Group remains cognizant of the institutional and fiscal developments taking place and is engaging with all levels of Government to see how it can sustainably contribute. The market is expected to grow with planned Government expenditure, especially after the issue of the euro US$ 2 billion bond, together with the drive from Government, quasi Government bodies and the private sector for increase in the supply of housing. I expect that, despite ever increasing competitive pressure in the market, the Group will experience growth. I expect the inland export markets out of Uganda to recover with greater political stability in those markets and the margin pressure in the domestic Uganda market to ease from 2014. I expect better power quality in Uganda following rehabilitation of the Kampala-Kasese transmission power line, whose completion is scheduled for the first quarter of 2014. I believe that our annual report presents a fair assessment of the Group’s performance and its future prospects. We have endeavored to provide good quality information in a clear manner and in line with our Corporate Governance policy together with application rules and regulations. Corporate Governance remains at the top of my agenda and I take this opportunity to remind you to read through our Statement of Corporate Governance included in this report. In the year, David Njoroge General Manager, Hima Cement Ltd, resigned from the Group and was replaced by Daniel Petterson. I take this opportunity to thank David for his service to the Group and the Board, and wish him well in his future endeavors. In December, Mutua Kilaka was appointed a member of the Board. The Group will continue to contribute in regional development by manufacturing products used to provide a decent living environment, encourage more sustainable land use by minimizing urban sprawl, help build structures to minimize the effects of natural disasters, connect people by building the transport infrastructure and create beautiful living spaces, villages, towns and cities. Execution of our strategic initiatives to enable us grow shareholder value, in addition to fulfilling our other obligations as a responsible corporate citizen, will always depend on the ability of our people – at all levels – to remain focused on their functions by bringing their collective expertise, energy and passion to the business. In this respect, let me assure you, our shareholders and stakeholders, that the Bamburi Group has a great team that is able to quickly respond to market place challenges. I take this opportunity to thank each and every member of this great team - Employees, Management and the Board of Directors - for their efforts throughout a very challenging year. Into the future, we shall continue to be a critical component of the growth story in the markets we operate in. To the shareholders, I am grateful for your continued support and I look forward to engaging with you at the Annual General Meeting and all other fora. Chairman’s Statement Dr. John P. N. Simba, OGW, MBS Chairman 10 Bamburi Cement Annual Report 2013 Managing Director’s Statement 2013 was a challenging year for the Group and, in this statement, I will highlight the main contributors to the results. The Group started the year cautiously with anticipation of the elections in Kenya, which saw a slow down in economic activity in the first half of the year. Safety, Health and Environment Safety, health and environment remain our number one priority. I sincerely believe that if we are able to operate safely, we will not only save lives but also have sustainable and profitable operations. In 2013, we continued with our programs on Visible Felt Leadership, Team Based Safety and the Safety Observation, which resulted in improved participation from all staff. Despite this improved participation, we recorded one lost time injury at Mombasa plant involving a third party contractor. Unfortunately, road safety remained a challenge and we had one fatality on the road in Uganda involving a contracted transporter. I believe that with sustained participation by all PROVIDING CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONS TO BUILD BETTER CITIES 60 years of Building Cities 11 Managing Director’s Statement the people on our sites, employees and contractors, we will succeed in our target of zero fatalities and zero injuries. We hosted the Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretary of Transport and Infrastructure at our site in Athi River during our annual Road Safety Campaign dubbed “Wajibika” which ran from Mombasa to Salgaa in December 2013. We continue to run these annual road campaigns as we seek to increase our involvement in road safety with the Government and other Stakeholders. We completed a Kshs. 275 million investment in the installation of a bag filter in Kasese plant in line with our global environmental ambitions. Operational and Financial Performance The Group’s turnover decreased by 10% to KShs. 33.9 billion mainly as a result of lower performance in Uganda mainly attributable to competitive pressure and lower exports to Inland Africa markets out of Uganda due to continued political tensions in those markets. In Kenya, both the domestic and export sales were behind prior year in the first four months of the year as the market demand slowed during the election period; the markets started showing signs of recovery in May and had rebounded by the start of the second half of the year. There was also a notable slowdown in the infractructure segment, where the Company is strongly positioned due to delayed payments to contractors on major projects, and this resulted in low demand in our infrastructure product category. We did, however, retain our market leadership position in Kenya and a stable share in Uganda. Pre-tax profit was Kshs. 1.6 billion behind 2012 closing at Kshs. 5.6 billion, largely a reflection of the lower revenue. To mitigate against this reduction, the Group increased the alternative fuel substitution to above 50% in Uganda and 7% at our Mombasa plant with December alone attaining a 21% substitution ratio. In addition, due to improved plant effeciencies, a 7% increase of clinker production resulted in reduced consumption of purchased clinker. In Kenya, power tariffs increased by 12% in December 2013. However, the Energy Regulatory Commission expects to reduce the base tariffs in the second half of 2014. In Uganda, there was power rationing due to scheduled rehabilitation of the transmission lines, and this continued to disrupt the operations at the plant. We continued to increase investment in brand support, with focus on developing our brand attributes, accompanied by a team able to translate our investment into growth. To develop the right team, we started a Sales Effectiveness Program developed specifically for Lafarge Group. It is my belief that this program, coupled with the use of the customer relationship management system launched in 2012, our team will be better trained and equipped to grow our share in an increasingly competitive market. Our aim is to create an environment where mobility and collaboration are enhanced through technology and this is particularly vital when in a high volume business spread over different geographical sites. We migrated our e-mail platform to Google with the intention of facilitating mobility and improve the collaboration throughout the business despite continued telecommunication challenges related to disruptions to the fiber optics lines connecting the business. Outlook for 2014 Opportunities The world economy is expected to improve further in 2014 and the consequent increase in demand will put pressure on commodity prices. In Kenya, the new Constitution and the Government agenda have brought about many opportunities. In addition, we expect the issue of the euro bond of US$ 2 billion by the Kenyan Government to reduce domestic borrowing and ease local interest rates which will spur domestic cement consumption. Further the devolved counties in Kenya are expected to have matured their processes, which would result in increased spend on the currently under utilized infrastructure development funds. The intention of the Government, quasi Government bodies and the private sector to develop more housing in the region coincides with the Lafarge vision of Building Better Cities. The improved infrastructure in the region is expected to lower medium term costs while a stable operating environment would improve productivity. Increased competition is likely to spur the development of new products and increase the sophistication with which Customers can use cement. As a Group, we have the necessary systems 12 Bamburi Cement Annual Report 2013 Managing Director’s Statement and infrastructure to take advantage of this development in the market. Challenges However, there are certain risks that have presented themselves that I, together with Chairman and the Board, will seek to address in 2014. The industry is expected to remain competitive with new products and offers. In Kenya, we will continue with all stakeholders at all levels to explore ways in which we can partner for mutual benefits. Unpredictable weather patterns in 2014 in Kenya may affect agriculture, and have a ripple effect on inflation and power tariffs, although we remain optimistic that a better power generation mix may further ease power costs. In Uganda, the cost reflective power tariff and the possible increased power rates from the second quarter of 2014 will remain a challenge. To mitigate against rising tariffs in both countries, the Group will focus on improved plant efficiencies through operational mastery with the aim of reducing the unit power consumption and increased alternative fuel substitution. Further, commissioning the KShs. 487 million Petcoke mill in the first quarter of 2014 in Uganda should significantly reduce the Group energy costs. As I conclude, I would like to highlight that the Group experienced solid growth in the last quarter of 2013, a trend which we expect to continue. We have a strong market leadership position and, with our strong brands, geographic coverage as well as skilled and motivated teams driving the top line through world class customer service, I believe that we will generate greater value for all stakeholders. Appreciation Through what was a truly challenging year, I was encouraged by the faith our customers continued to show in our brands while our staff displayed commitment, resilience and persistence. The Group experienced greater engagement with the Governments in the region, communities as well as other stakeholders. To our customers, our people, regional Governments and stakeholders, I extend my sincere gratitude. Our promise remains to provide construction solutions that will build better cities and improve the lives of our communities in a sustainable way and I count on your support in 2014 and beyond.
